# A-Deep-Learning-based-Diabetic-Foot-Wound-Classifier-and-Screening-Tool

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a specialized application designed for diabetic foot patients. The primary goal of the application is to protect users from diabetic foot wound severity by facilitating direct communication between patients and doctors. The application leverages three deep learning models:

1. **Wound Classifier Model:** This model is responsible for classifying the severity of diabetic foot wounds.(Infection , Ischemeai , Both ,None)
2. **Wound Segmentation Model:** The wound segmentation model is designed to identify and delineate the boundaries of diabetic foot wounds.
3. **Sticker Segmentation Model:** This model focuses on segmenting stickers or indicators placed on the foot for monitoring purposes    

## How It Works

The application utilizes the aforementioned deep learning models to predict the wound area and provide valuable insights for both patients and healthcare professionals. The workflow involves:

1. **Wound Classification:** The severity of a diabetic foot wound is classified using the Wound Classifier Model.

2. **Wound Segmentation:** The boundaries of the identified wound are segmented using the Wound Segmentation Model.

3. **Sticker Segmentation:** Stickers or markers on the foot are segmented using the Sticker Segmentation Model.

4. **Prediction and Analysis:** The combined information from the segmentation models is used to predict the wound area and provide a comprehensive analysis.
